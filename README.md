DESCRIPTION :</li>

This is a Java-based scientific calculator built using Swing for the graphical user interface. It supports basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %) along with advanced mathematical functions, including trigonometry (sin, cos, tan), logarithms (log, ln), exponentiation (x^y), square roots (âˆš), and factorials (x!). The calculator allows parentheses for complex expressions and provides a toggle for radian and degree modes when performing trigonometric calculations.

The application features a JTextField display for input/output and a grid-based button panel for user interaction. Each button press is handled via an ActionListener, updating the input dynamically. Expression evaluation is performed using the Shunting Yard algorithm, ensuring proper operator precedence and efficient computation. The calculator also includes error handling to prevent invalid inputs or undefined operations.

With a simple and intuitive UI, this scientific calculator is a useful tool for solving a wide range of mathematical problems.</li>
